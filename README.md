# Eye Diseases Self Diagnostic with VGG19 Model
The Eye Diseases Self Diagnostic project is aimed at creating a user-friendly tool to assist individuals in assessing potential eye diseases based on images of their eyes. This project utilizes the powerful VGG19 convolutional neural network (CNN) model to analyze input eye images and predict the likelihood of various eye diseases. By leveraging deep learning technology, this tool empowers users to perform an initial self-assessment of their eye health in the comfort of their own homes.

## Features
- Disease Classification: The VGG19 model is trained to classify eye images into different disease categories, such as cataracts, glaucoma, macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy.
- Probability Assessment: For each disease category, the model provides a probability score, indicating the likelihood of the presence of that particular disease in the uploaded image.
- Educational Resources: Alongside the predictions, the tool offers educational resources and information about various eye diseases to help users understand the implications and potential next steps.

## Model Architecture
The backbone of this project is the VGG19 (Visual Geometry Group 19) convolutional neural network model. VGG19 is a deep learning architecture known for its excellent performance in image classification tasks. It has been pretrained on a large dataset in this project.

## Dataset
The project employs a curated dataset of labeled eye images, encompassing various eye diseases and healthy samples. This dataset was carefully compiled, cleaned, and preprocessed to ensure high-quality training and validation of the VGG19 model.
